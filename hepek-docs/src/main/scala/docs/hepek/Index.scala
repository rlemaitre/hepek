        Hepek turns Scala `object`s into files.
        Everything that you can `println`, *Hepek* can write to a file.

        It contains lots of useful functions for *rendering stuff*, 
          like blogging support, themes, PDF rendering etc.  
        There is no special new markup/template language to learn, just plain old **Scala**.  
        `Ctrl` + `Space` and you get all the help needed.
        You can use Scalatags, Markdown or whatever syntax **you** find useful.

        You can ask maybe, so what?  
        This is yet another SSG, what makes it so special?  
        So, say goodbye to emmet snippets and regex find-and-replace...
        Now you can use functions, for loops, data abstractions etc. What more do you need really?  

        Also, since content is just a Scala `object`, you can use it directly
          to construct table of contents, RSS feed, `sitemap.xml`, PDF and Word docs.  

        Sick of rewriting relative urls all over the place, like `my/folder/../styles.....`?  
        Me too, the year is ${currYear.getYear()}, we can do better!  
        Just use `.ref` method and you're done! Hepek figures out path instead of you.

        Hepek uses *incremental rendering* by default.  
        If you change an object, it only renders objects which depend on it. Neat!

        Linux, OSX, Windows supported? Of course. Thanks JVM!  

        And, yes, this site is built with Hepek.
