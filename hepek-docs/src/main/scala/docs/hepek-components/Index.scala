          Hepek Components contain the core components of Hepek SSG and Hepek Play.  
          These are mostly wrappers around Scalatags.  

          Components are *interface-based* so we can compose them easily and replace with no effort.  
          In a nutshell, this means you can **choose HTML framework implementation**: Bootstrap3/Bulma.  

          In order to group components, Hepek has a concept of `Bundle`.  
          Every framework fills it with its own implementations of components.  
          Proceed to [next page](${Bundle.ref}) for more detailed explanation.
